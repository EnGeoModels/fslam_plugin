description=Fast Shallow Landslide Assessment Model (FSLAM)
version=1.0.0
author=Zizheng Guo
email=cuggzz@cug.edu.cn, zizhengguo1@gmail.com

about=FSLAM plugin is based on physical model which integrates a simplified hydrological model and the infinite slope theory to compute landslide stability. It aims to reduce computational time and address soil uncertainties when dealing with regional landslide susceptibility assessment. The current version contains two foundational functions: runoff and stability modelling. Raster outputs regarding several aspects can be obtained, including factor of safety (FS), probability of failure (PoF), topography, hydrology and infiltration. It can be used to conduct parameter calibration and landslide susceptibility assessment. It also can be used for the quantitative analysis of impacts of future climate and vegetation changes. See "info" tab of the plugin for more information.
